# Continual Pre-Training with Replay + Gradient Alignment (GPT-NeoX)

This repository provides a **GPT-NeoX/Megatron-DeepSpeed** pipeline to perform **continual pre-training (CPT)** with:
- **Experience Replay** using a disk-backed buffer (async prefetch + RAM cache) mixed into each batch.
- **Gradient Alignment** via lightweight **Reptile/MER** meta-updates applied at a configurable cadence.

## Highlights

- Drop-in **mixed-batch replay** that plugs into NeoX’s dataloader loop.
- **Disk-resident** buffer with streaming writes, and prefetch to hide I/O latency.
- **MER/Reptile** hook that interpolates weights every *k* steps with negligible compute/memory overhead.
- Metrics scripts for **Forgetting Score**, **Retained Loss**, and **Learned Loss**, plus **lm-eval** integration.

# How It Works (brief)
Mixed-batch replay: each step draws (1−α) samples from the current task stream and α from the disk buffer M.

Disk-backed buffer: examples are appended as they arrive + async prefetch keeps GPUs fed.

MER/Reptile: every k steps, interpolate current weights toward the weights from the last k steps (θ ← (1−ε)·θ + ε·θ_k).
